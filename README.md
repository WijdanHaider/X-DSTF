# X-DSTF: Explainable Dual-Stream Transformer Fusion Framework for AI-generated
Image Classification
In this paper, we propose the X-DSTF framework, a dual-stream transformer-based architecture for synthetic media forensics. In the current release, we provide the complete model architecture, preprocessing pipeline, and efficiency benchmarking scripts. We also included a detailed Reproducibility Appendix specifying all hyperparameters, dataset splits, and experimental settings.
